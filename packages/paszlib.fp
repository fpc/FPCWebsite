<h1>Paszlib: Support for gzip format and <TT>.gz</TT> files.</h1>
Paszlib is a pure pascal translation of the zlib library, implemented
by Jacques Nomssi Nzali 
(see also <a href="http://www.nomssi.de/paszlib/paszlib.html">his home page</a>.)
It is used in the FCL to implement the <TT>TCompressionstream</TT> class.

The main unit of this package is <tt>paszlib</tt>. there are other,
auxiliary units, but the unly unit that needs to be included in a
typical program is this one.
