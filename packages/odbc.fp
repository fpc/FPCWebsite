<h1>ODBC : Universal database access.</h1>
This package contains one unit <tt>odbcsql</tt> which contains the header
file translations of the ODBC system. It works on the windows ODBC
implementation and works with UnixODBC as well - it was tested on both. 
(<a href="http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/packages/odbcsql">View interface</a>)
<p> 
The test program <TT>testodbc</TT> accesses a MS-Access database and runs a
query on it.
<p>
The FCL contains a unit fpodbc which contains an OOP wrapper around the ODBC
calls, which makes ODBC programming considerably easier and more
pascal-like.
