<H1>Project closed down due to patent infringement</H1>
<p>
The Free Pascal Compiler development team has discovered that the Free Pascal Compiler infringes on patent number <A HREF="http://l2.espacenet.com/espacenet/viewer?PN=EP0646864&CY=ep&LG=en&DB=EPD"> EP0646864 </A> <i>(click on the &quot;Claims&quot; button to see the description)</i>, granted by the European Patent Office to Nippon Electric Co in 1995. This is a <b>software patent on the principle of optimising compilers</b>. Unfortunately, it appears we have unknowingly stolen this incredible <i>invention</i> and added optimisation functionality to our compiler without asking them for a license first.

<H2>Did you know that the above paragraph could turn into reality if the European Parliament approves the proposed directive on software patents September 1st?</H2>
<p>
Although software and business method patents are currently illegal in Europe, <A HREF="http://swpat.ffii.org/players/epo/index.en.html">the European Patents Office</A> (EPO) has been granting them anyway (because they make good money doing so). Now, <b>certain people in the European Parliament are trying to legalise this kind of <A HREF="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/eubsa-swpat0202/tech/#cecjuri">unlimited patentability</A>, instead of telling the EPO to respect the law!</b>
