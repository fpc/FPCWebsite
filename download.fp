Sorry, no Dos release yet. The Dos platform is missing a maintainer and is not
of acceptable quality for 2.0.

<H2>Snapshots</H2>
<P>
In addition to the official releases, we also offer so-called "snapshots" of the compiler, RTL,
IDE and a couple of other packages on the <A HREF="develop.html">development page</A>. These
are compiled versions of the current sources with all fixes and improvements since the last
official release, so please try them if you have any problems. Of course, they may also contain
new bugs.


<H2>Old releases</H2>
<P>
Links to some old releases (not supported any more) of FPC for platforms for
which no better alternative exists can be found
<A HREF="down/old/down.html">here</A>. Don't bother to report any bugs
with these old releases - we will not fix them.
