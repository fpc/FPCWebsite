<h2>Using Free Pascal in education</h2>
Pascal has excellent capabilities for education. It enforces structured programming,
and its strong typing learns students the differences between data types. It is easy
to learn, has very readable code and is popular under students because it
is a language that can be used to build real, useful, programs.
<p>
Besides procedural programming, modern Pascal is also an excellent choice for object
oriented programming, its object oriented extensions have been implemented much more
cleanly than in other languages.
<p>
Free Pascal is an excellent compiler to use in education. It generates very friendly
error messages, so your students will find out more easily what is wrong with their
programs. It's integrated development environment provides a complete ready to use
environment to start programming on and is very user friendly. It is a better choice
than RAD development tools like Delphi, because such environments move the focus
from programming to GUI developments. If necessary, Free Pascal can provide such
an environment by means of <a href='http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org'>Lazarus</a>.
<p>
Free Pascal also comes with excellent documentation, which provides a good reference for
people how to use the compiler. It should be combined with an introduction to
programming book. Because of it's excellent compatibility with both Turbo Pascal and
Delphi, books for both systems can be used.

Tips for use in education:
<ul>
  <li>Pascal can be used to build real world applications. Showing this to your
      pupils will motivate them.</li>
  <li>People often contact the Free Pascal development team about homework.
      Make them clear how to get help. Regarding Free Pascal, they can <i>only</i>
      get help on the forums and <i>only if</i> they are stuck at a specific
      point and can explain exactly at what point they are stuck.
  <li>Make good use of some of the standard units. Quite a bit of them will
      allow your pupils to achieve nice results quickly.</li>
  <li>Make sure the documentation is available to your pupils, and make them
      aware of the error messages explanations.</li>
  <li>A German translation of the documentation is available from C&L
      Publishers.</li>
