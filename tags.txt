The new website build tool uses an enhanced html-syntax known as adp.

This document describes the syntax.

1. Tags
=======

<MASTER src='master-template'>

The master tag inserts the current document in another document, which is
called a master template. If no master template is given, default-master.adp
is used.

<SLAVE>

The slave tag is used in a master template to specify where in the document
the slave has to be inserted.

<PROPERTY name='key'>value</PROPERTY>

The property tag can be used to pass data to a master template. Basically it
is a variable that is set to a value.

<IF condition>content</IF>

The if tag can be used in master templates to generate content based on
properties set in the slaves.

<ELSE>content</ELSE>

An else tag can follow an if tag and generates content if the condition was
false.

<TRN key='website.keyname' locale='locale'>content</TRN>

This tag marks content for translation. If a translation with the specified key
exists, the content in the translation catalog is expanded instead of the content
between the start and end tag.


2. Property expansion
=====================

If the preprocessor encounters a text containing @property_name@, it looks up
a property with the specified name and expands its value in the html text.

Properties cannot be expanded in the same document where they are defined, but
can be expanded in a master.
