<a name="release"></a><h2>Official releases</h2>
<p>
  These are ready made packages, together with an install program, to
  get you up and running in no time. All packages contain a README file,
  which you should read for installation instructions and latest news.
<p>
  The latest release is <b>2.0.4</b>.
<p>
Because of a lack of release builders and testers, 2.0.4 is only available for a limited
number of platforms and not in all package formats. If you want to change this and build and test future
releases, contact us via the mailing lists.

<h2>Snapshots</h2>
<p>
In addition to the official releases, we also offer so-called "snapshots" of the compiler, RTL,
IDE and a couple of other packages on the <a href="develop@x@">development page</a>. These
are compiled versions of the current sources with all fixes and improvements since the last
official release, so please try them if you have any problems. Of course, they may also contain
new bugs.
</p>

<h2>Old releases</h2>
<p>
Links to some old releases (not supported any more) of FPC for platforms for
which no better alternative exists at the moment can be found
<a href="down/old/down@x@">here</a>. Don't bother to report any bugs
with these old releases - we will not fix them. The main reason why these
platforms aren't supported any more is lack of maintainers - if you are
interested to bring them up to date, contact us (e.g. using fpc-devel mailing
list).
