This directory is just to collect used noghtly testsuite scripts:

It is organized into subdirectories with the name of the machine
they are running on, as seem in the testsuite database.


Most of the files assumed that the script is located inside
$HOME/bin directory.

On Linux systems, a simple symbolic link is used to have changes to the script
reflected to the repository, but it still needed to be committed by the person
who uses these scripts.
