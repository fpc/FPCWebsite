    The language syntax has excellent compatibility with TP 7.0 as well as
    with most versions of Delphi (classes, rtti, exceptions, ansistrings, widestrings, interfaces).
    A Mac Pascal mode, largely compatible with Think Pascal and MetroWerks Pascal, is also available.
    Furthermore Free Pascal supports function overloading, operator overloading, global properties and
    several other extra features.
