Free Pascal - Advantages of programming in Pascal and Free Pascal

<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.Advantages_title">
Advantages of Free Pascal
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.Advantages_of">

  Maybe you think, why should I choose Pascal instead of, for example C. Or
  maybe you are comparing Free Pascal to another Pascal compiler. Well, in
  that case, be sure to read this page before making your decision. Well,
  for what is Free Pascal so good?

</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_very_clean_lang">

      <STRONG>Very clean language</STRONG> Pascal is a very nice language,
      your programs will be more readable and maintainable than for example in
      C, and let's even forget about C++. And you don't need to give up the
      power, the Pascal language is as powerful as you want it.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_No_Makefiles">

      <STRONG>No Makefiles</STRONG> Unlike most programming languages,
      Pascal does not need Makefiles. You can save huge amounts of time, the
      compiler just figures out itself which files need to be recompiled.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_Fast">

      <STRONG>Pascal compilers are Fast with a big F and Free Pascal
      is no exception.</STRONG> Yes, you no longer need to grow roots while
      compiling your programs, just hit the compile key and it's done, even
      for large programs.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_namespace">

      <STRONG>Each unit has it's own identifiers</STRONG> In Pascal you
      never need to worry about polluting the namespace, like in C where
      an identifier needs to be unique accross the entire program. No, in
      Pascal each unit gets it's own namespace and that's very relaxed.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_Fast_code">

      <STRONG>High speed, low memory use</STRONG> Being a language that is
      compiled into fast machine code by a modern compiler, Free Pascal
      has been able to make Pascal one of the fastest languages there are.
      Further, Free Pascal programs tend to use little memory.
      For comparison with other languages we suggest the
      <A href='http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all'>Shootout benchmark</A>
      and recommend you modify the weights to your own taste.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_IDE">

      <STRONG>Integrated development environment</STRONG> Free Pascal comes
      with an IDE which work on several platforms, in which you can write, compile
      and debug your programs. You will save huge amounts of time using the IDE,
      the best programming friend you have.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_assembler_integration">

      <STRONG>Great integration with assembler</STRONG> Do you think pascal is
      for wimps who need to learn programming? WRONG! It's excellent for high tech
      programming and for the supreme nerds among you we have the integrated
      assemblers. You can easily mix assembler code and Pascal code, in the
      language you wish? Prefer Intel styled assembler? No problem, if it's needed
      Free Pascal will convert it to ATT for you. Do you want to convert your
      program into a source file for Nasm? No problem, and all ATT assembler in
      your source files is automatically converted.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_OOP">

      <STRONG>Object oriented programming</STRONG> And if you do the serious
      programming, you are of course very interested in object oriented
      programming. Use the Turbo Pascal and Object Pascal ways of OOP according
      to your taste. The FCL and Free Vision and provide you with the powerful
      object libraries you need. For your database needs we support PostgreSQL,
      MySQL, Interbase and ODBC.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_Smartlink">

      <STRONG>Smartlinking</STRONG> Free Pascal's smart linker leaves out any
      variable or code that you do not use. That makes small programs small with
      a big S, while they are still statically linked, avoiding DLL hell!
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_distribution_indep">

      <STRONG>Distribution independence (Linux)</STRONG> As a result of this,
      software compiled by the Linux version of Free Pascal runs on any
      Linux distribution, making it much, much, easier to make your software
      support multiple Linux distributions.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_multiplatform">

      <STRONG>Available for a lot of platforms on several architectures</STRONG>
      Free Pascal is
      available for more platforms than most other Pascal compilers and allows
      easy cross-compiling, just change the target in the IDE and compile! And
      there is work going on for even more platforms and processors.
    
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.adv_compatible">

      <STRONG>Compatible</STRONG> Have existing code? Free Pascal is more
      compatible with it than any other Pascal compiler. We are almost completely
      compatible with Turbo Pascal and quite well compatible with Delphi source
      code. If you have code in another language, like C or assembler, just
      use favorite compiler for it and call it from Free Pascal.

<a name="svn"></a><h3>Connect to Source Repository with SVN</h3>
<p>
As an alternative to the daily zip files of the SVN sources,
the SVN repository has been made accessible for everyone,
with read-only access. This means that you can always have access to
the latest source code. It is also a method
which requires less bandwidth once you have done the first download (called a &quot;checkout&quot; in SVN lingo).
</p>
<p>
<b>Development snapshots</b>
</p>
<p>
How do you obtain the sources via SVN? Generally, you need 3 steps:<br>
(once you have SVN installed, of course. Look <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">here</a> for instructions on
how to do that.)
</p>

</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.develop.fpc">

<OL>
<li> To retrieve the full fpc source repository,
type
<PRE>
svn checkout https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk fpc
</PRE>
This will create a directory called &quot;fpc&quot; in the current directory, containing
subdirectories with the following components:

<ul>
<li><b>rtl</b>, the run time library source code for all platforms.</li>
<li><b>compiler</b>, the compiler source code.</li>
<li><b>packages</b>, packages source code (contains Free Component Library, gtk, ncurses, mysql and many more)</li>
<li><b>utils</b>, the utilities source code.</li>
<li><b>tests</b>, the compiler and RTL tests.</li>
<li><b>installer</b>, the text mode installer source code.</li>
</ul>

If you do not want the entire repository, you can check out subsections
using, e.g.,

<PRE>
svn checkout https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/trunk/rtl fpc/rtl
</PRE>

<p>
Normally, you should perform this checkout step just once.
</p>
<li> To update the sources that were downloaded (checked out) above to the latest available version, use
<PRE>
svn update fpc
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
svn update fpc/rtl
</PRE>
if you only downloaded some separate components, such as the rtl sources in this case.<br>
These commands will retrieve patches <em>ONLY</EM> for the files that have
changed on the server. <br>
<p>
You can repeat this step whenever you want to update your sources. It is by
far the most economic way to remain up-to-date in terms of bandwidth.

</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.develop.fixes32x">

<p>
<b>Fixes to 3.2.x </b>
</p>
<p>
The sources of the fixes branch need a separate directory, so create a separate directory fixes, enter it, and repeat
the above checkout command with the URL https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/branches/fixes_3_2:
</p>
<pre>
cd mysvn/fixes
svn checkout https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/branches/fixes_3_2 fpc
</pre>

and to update:

<pre>
svn update fpc
</pre>

<p>
To checkout a release, you have to checkout the tagged versions, e.g.
svn checkout https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpc/tags/release_3_2_0 fpc
</p>

<p>
The sources of docs are in a separate repository called &quot;fpcdocs&quot;, so the command to get them is
<pre>
svn checkout https://svn.freepascal.org/svn/fpcdocs/trunk fpcdocs
</pre>

<p>
  These are ready made packages, together with an install program, to
  get you up and running in no time. All packages contain a README file,
  which you should read for installation instructions. Please, note that
  these versions are <EM>not supported</EM> any more and only kept available
  in case they are useful for somebody as they are. Getting these versions
  supported again would require a dedicated maintainer for the given platform
  and some effort to bring the platform working with latest FPC releases.

            <p>Originally named FPK-Pascal, the Free Pascal compiler is a 16,32
            and 64 bit Turbo Pascal and Delphi compatible Pascal compiler for
            Linux, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, DOS and
            several other platforms (the number of supported targets grows
            all the time, although not all of them are on the same level as
            the main ones).

            <p>The Free Pascal compiler is available for several
            architectures: x86 (16,32 and 64 bit), ARM, PowerPC (32 and 64 bit),
            SPARC (v8, v9), Java Virtual Machine (under development) and MIPS (little and big endian, under development).
            An older version (the 1.0 series) and current development versions also supported m68k.

            <p>The compiler is written in Pascal and is able to compile its
            own sources. The source files are distributed under the GPLv2+ and included.

            <p>The latest official version is 3.2.0, the first release in the 3.2.x series.
            New development is performed in the 3.3.x series, which will eventually
            be released as 3.4.0 or 4.0.0, depending on milestones achieved.

            <h4>Historic versions</h4>

            <p>FPC's version numbering changed a few times over the years. Pre-1.0 versioning information has been
			moved to the <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/1.0_versioning">Wiki 1.0 versioning article.</a>

            <h4>Modern versioning</h4>

            <p>With the release of 1.0, the version numbering was
            slightly changed to a system resembling one used for the Linux
            kernels.

            <p>
            <ul>
             <li>Releases that only fix bugs in version 1.0 are numbered 1.0.x.
             <li>Post-1.0 development (the so called snapshots) have version number
              1.1.x.
             <li>Eventually the 1.1.x versions, when stabilized, were released
              as the 2.0.x series, preceded by betas marked as 1.9.x. Fixes to the
              2.0 release were numbered 2.0.x, fixes to the 2.2 release 2.2.x, fixes to the 2.4 release as 2.4.x etc</li>
             <li>The new development version after the 2.4.0 release was numbered 2.5.x
              and so on.
		<li>Repackagings that affect sources are indicated with a single letter as
			suffix (e.g. 2.0.4a). This is usually the case for platforms that weren't part of the original release round.
             <li>The stable branch (currently, fixes_3_0, previously fixes_2_6) always has an odd last number (2.6.1, 2.6.3 and 3.0.1).
                 Compilers with such versions are snapshots, and e.g. a snapshot with 2.6.1 can
 		 be anywhere between 2.6.0 and the moment 2.6.2 branched off (Jan 2013). Likewise,
		 after the release of 2.6.2 the fixes_2_6 branch identified itself as version 2.6.3 till 2.6.4 branched off (typically
 		 two months before its release).  After 2.6.4, the stable branch's number was updated to 2.6.5,
		 after 3.0.2 to 3.0.3 etc.
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>Normally, you would want to use a release. Releases are considered
            stable, and easier to support (the bugs, quirks and unintended
            "features" are well known after a period of time, and workarounds
            exist).

            <p>Development snapshots (which are generated daily) reflect the current
            status of the compiler. Development versions probably have new features
            and larger bugs fixed since the last release, but might have some
            temporary stability drawbacks (which are usually fixed by the next day).

            <p>Development snapshots are often quite useful for certain categories of
            users. Ask on the mailing lists if it is worth the trouble in your case if
            you are not sure.

            <p>Snapshots of the stable branch (fixes_3_0) are meant to test release engineering. They are
		mainly interesting in the months before a release to extensively
		test the branch from which the release is created.

            <p>We advise all users to upgrade to the newest version for their
            target (preferably the new stable 3.0.x series).

            <DT><b>Aim:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal tries to implement a Borland compatible pascal
            compiler on as many platforms as possible. GNU Pascal tries to
            implement a portable pascal compiler based on POSIX.
            <DT><b>Version:</b>
            <DD>Currently, Free Pascal is at version 3.2.0 (June 2020). GNU Pascal is stopped
            version 2.1 (from 2002, which can be built with several different GCC's as backend;
            their Mac OS X version is an exception though, as it follows the GCC version number).</DD>
            <DT><b>Tracking:</b>
            <DD>Between releases, development versions of FPC are available through daily snapshots
	        and the source via SVN. GPC issues a set of patches to the last version a few times
            a year, and there are regular snapshot for OS X and Windows, made by users.
            <DT><b>Operating systems:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal runs on a large number of platforms,
            inlcuding DOS (16/32-bit), Win32 (no UNIX porting layer needed), Linux, FreeBSD,
            NetBSD, OS/2, BeOS, Mac OS X, on the following architectures:
            x86 (32 and 64 bit),
            SPARC, PowerPC (32 and 64 bit), ARM, Java Virtual Machine (under development), and
            MIPS (under development).

            GNU Pascal runs basically on any system that supported by GCC, and for which the build process was verified.
            <DT><b>Bootstrapping:</b>
            <DD>FPC requires a suitable set of binutils (AS, AR, LD) on some platforms, GNU make and a command line bootstrap compiler. New architectures/OSes are cross-compiled.
	        GPC bootstraps via a suitable version of GCC, and requires a full set of binutils, flex, bison, gmake, a POSIX shell and libtool
            <DT><b>Sources:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal is entirely written in Pascal, while GNU Pascal is written in C (it's an adaptation of the GNU
            C compiler)
            <DT><b>Language:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal supports the Borland Pascal dialect,
            implements the Delphi Object Pascal language, Objective-Pascal and has some support for ISO 7185 Pascal and Mac Pascal extensions.
            GNU Pascal supports ISO 7185, ISO 10206 and (most of) Borland Pascal 7.0
            <DT><b>Extensions:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal implements method, function and operator overloading (later Delphi versions have also added these, so strictly they are not extensions anymore)
            GNU Pascal implements operator overloading.
            <DT><b>License:</b>
            <DD>Both compilers come under the GNU GPL.
            <DT><b>Author:</b>
            <DD>Free Pascal was started by Florian Kl&auml;mpfl, Germany

            Generally Free Pascal generates smaller binaries than modern competing compilers,
            however, it does not hide code in large dynamic libraries. Free Pascal generates
            larger binaries than compilers from long ago do. Large framework libraries result
            in larger executables.

       FPC's primary goal is to be a Turbo Pascal and Delphi-compatible compiler, and it also
       supports a subset of the Mac-Pascal dialect and of Standard ISO Pascal. While in theory it would be possible
       to add a complete ISO Standard or Extended Pascal modes, until now no people interested in
       such functionality have stepped up to work on such features.
       <p>
       <a href="http://www.gnu-pascal.de/">GNU-Pascal</a> is however a modern compiler that can

	   Occasionally, users ask about a FPC that supports .NET, or our
	   plans in that direction. <p>

	   Mainly the users are either interested because of .NET's
	   portability aspects (Mono is quoted over and over again), or
	   because it is supposed to be the next big thing in Windows
	   programming, and they think Windows programming will not be possible
	   in the future.<p>

           While the FPC core developpers are somewhat interested out of
	   academic curiousity (mainly because it could be a pilot for a
	   generalized backend creating bytecode) there are however several
	   problems with .NET in combination with FPC:

        <OL>
        <li>
           Pascal is a language that uses pointers, and existing codebases
	   can only be unmanaged. Unmanaged code is not portable under .NET,
	   so that already kills most possible benefits. This also means that
	   existing FPC and Delphi code won't run on .NET. There are more
	   such little language problems.</li>

	<li>FPC's libraries are not based on .NET classes and data models (and
 	   cannot be changed to do so without effectively rewriting them),
 	   moreover the libraries could only be unmanaged too, or they
	   would be incompatible</li>

 	<li>There is nothing <em>practical</em> known yet about how portable
	    an average .NET program will be. Little experiments with hello
	    world level code mean nothing, that kind of code works with
	    nearly any language. A good test would be to see existing non trivial
	    codebases run unmodified under mono, that were not designed with mono
            in mind. Just like we try to do for
	    Delphi</li>

        <li> The fact that on Windows 80% of the .NET code seems to be
 	    ASP.NET does not help either. This makes porting existing code
 	    less useful (since ASP.NET is tied to IIS), and new codebases of
 	    portable code can be set in nearly every language </li>

 	<li>Operating System dependant code would not work anymore, since
	     the Win32/64 interface is unmanaged.
	</OL> <p>

    So effectively this means that for FPC to benefit from .NET you
    would have to significantly adapt the language (thus compiler) and
    libraries, and be incompatible with the existing native sourcecode.
    Moreover
    that also means that existing apps would have to be rewritten for
    .NET, since it would take more than a simple recompile with a
    FPC/.NET compiler.<p>

    While unmanaged code has some uses (easier integration with managed
    code inside Windows), this still requires writing a code generator and
    defining interfaces and libraries. This means a <b>lot of work</b> and
    since .NET take-up is not really high, this might not be worth it. <p>

    However if a FPC user does the bulk of the work (e.g. a bytecode
    codegenerator, and maybe some base libraries) and if the work is
    suitable for inclusion in FPC (a very big if), we will of course
    include it.<p>

    Since support for <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_JVM">generating JVM bytecode</a> has been added to the
    compiler, such a project may be more realistic now than it has been
    in the past. Many of the caveats mentioned above still hold though:
    language compatibility is not 100% and most standard units will have
    to be reimplemented.<p>

            <p>Because the compiler supports multiple processor architectures, it

            correctly on all processors.
            <ul>
              <li>Limit your use of asm statements unless it is time critical code
              <li>Try not to rely on the endianness of the specific machines when performing operations depending on data layout. In particular, reading and writing binary data
              to/from files will probably require byte swaps across different endianness
              machines (swapendian is your friend in this case). Freepascal defines
              <CODE>FPC_LITTLE_ENDIAN</CODE> or <CODE>FPC_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE> to indicate the
              target endianness.
              <li>Try limiting your local variables in subroutines to 32K, as this
              is the limit of some processors. Use dynamic allocation instead.
              <li>Try limiting the size of parameters passed to subroutines to 32K,
              as this is the limit of some processors. Use const or var parameters
              where appropriate.
              <li><TT>CPU16</TT>,<TT>CPU32</TT> or <TT>CPU64</TT> is defined indicating
              whether the target is a 16,32-bit or 64-bit cpu. This can help with
              incorporating 16,32-bit and 64-bit specific code.

              <li>Use the <TT>ptruint</TT> type when declaring an ordinal that will store
              a pointer, since pointers can be either 32-bit or 64-bit depending on
              the processor and operating system. For 16-bit it is memory model dependent.

            <p>Because the compiler supports several different operating systems,

            <ul>
              <li>File sharing is implemented differently on different operating

              systems (such as Windows). The only correct way to make sure to
              have the same file sharing behavior is to use the I/O routines
              provided by the <TT>sysutils</TT> unit.
              <li>Clean up at the end of your program, i.e. close all files on exit, and

              when some things are left allocated or opened.
              <li> Some operating systems limit the stack space that can be allocated,
              therefore it is important to limit subroutine nesting, and the number of
              local variables. Limiting total stack space usage at a given moment to
              at most 256 KBytes will make porting easier.

			codebase. Practically it means it must make something
			possible that cannot be done otherwise or be a compatibility

	    chances are slim.  Remarks as &quot;this will attract a lot of

            <p>So, a call to <CODE>reset</CODE> on non-text files does <EM>not</EM>
               indicate that the file will be opened read-only. So, trying to open a file
               using <CODE>reset</CODE> with the defaults will fail on read-only files.
               <CODE>filemode</CODE> should be set to 0 (Real-only access) before

            <p>You should use native OS/2 applications under OS/2 (including the native OS/2

            <p>
            You are most probably using an older version of OS/2 (like OS/2 Warp 3.0)
            and do not have TZ variable in your environment. The easiest solution is to add

            of western and central Europe) line to your CONFIG.SYS, and restart OS/2.
            The proper setting for you can be found e.g. using the TZCALC tool from
            <a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/internet/time/time868f.zip">TIME868</a>

            <p>An updated version of GNU assembler (as.exe) is packaged with release 1.9.6 (newer version
            was necessary to get support for features of modern CPUs). This version of the GNU tool
            was created with Innotek port of GNU C and relies on its libc. This results in higher
            limitations regarding supported configurations, because this libc needs recent version
            of OS/2 Unicode support libraries (LIBUNI.DLL and UCONV.DLL) not available in base OS/2 Warp 3.0
            and OS/2 Warp 4.0. The updated versions were distributed by IBM in corrective packages (fixpaks)
            - see e.g. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080103002005/http://www.warpupdates.mynetcologne.de/english/basesystem.html">WarpUpdates site</a>
            for information about OS/2 fixpaks and links for downloading them.
            This issue isn't valid for WarpServer for e-Business, MCP and eComStation - these already have

            <p>Apart from the point mentioned <a href="#os2-fp">above</a>,
            there is at least one more potential reason for issues with
            executing the assembler and resulting in error message "Can't call
            the assembler, error 2 switching to external assembling". This
            error may be result of the OS/2 system not being able to find DLLs
            required for the assembler. Make sure that you installed FPC
            completely (these DLLs are part of file asldos2.zip) and that you
            have set LIBPATH according to instructions in README.TXT (and
            restarted afterwards). If in doubts, running the assembler directly
            from the command line (e.g. "as --version" to show the installed
            as.exe version) may be helpful to see name of the missing dynamic
            library or other details about the problem.

                         stack sizes for this target are small, it is recommended
                         to always compile software with stack checking enabled.
                    <li> By default, the compiler generates code for the 68020+

                         to you to implement CPU verification at program startup. The
                         standard runtime libraries have been compiled for the
                         68000 target, and should not cause any problems.
                    <li> All floating point operations are simulated,
                         and use the <TT>single</TT> floating point type.
                         You will need to recompile all standard runtime
                         libraries and your application, with the software floating point
                         option off, if you wish to use hardware floating point.

FCL - Free Component Library
</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.fcl.introduction">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Free Component Library is meant to be an free equivalent of Delphi's
VCL - only all components in this library are non-visual. Visual components
are the domain of other projects such as <a href="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/">Lazarus</a> or <a href="http://mseide-msegui.sourceforge.net/">MSEide+MSEgui</a>.
<p> The idea of FCL is to give a complete set of classes, so a programmer is
    able to tackle most common programming tasks; wherever possible we try to
    keep Delphi compatibility, so code written for one compiler can be compiled
    by the other.

</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.fcl.helping">

<h2>Helping out</h2>
The FCL is maintained by the Free Pascal team, and is distributed along with
the compiler. Everyone is free to donate components, or to implement
improvements in the existing components. Though the components should be
more or less Delphi compatible, this should not be seen as a restriction.

If you think you have some component that can be useful, or would like to
implement some component, please contact <a href="mailto:michael@freepascal.org">Michael Van Canneyt</a>.

</TRN>
<TRN locale="en_US" key="website.fcl.status">

<h2>Current status</h2>
The FCL is under continuous development, as many components are being added.
As we go along, we try to keep the following <a href="classchart.gif">class
chart</a> up to date.

At the moment the Free Component Library contains the following units
(in alphabetical order):
<DL>
    <DT>base64
    <DD> Implements base64 encoding/decoding streams.
    <DT>classes
    <DD> Implements the Delphi Classes unit, with several utility classes such as
        streams, stringlists, TPersistent, TWriter and so on.
    <DT>db
    <DD> Contains a <b>TDataset</b> implementation, together with TDatabase aware
        descendents.
    <DT>ddg_ds
    <DD> Contains a <b>TDataset</b> descendent that works on a flat file (file of
        record).
    <DT>dom
    <DD> Contains a Free Pascal implementation of a Document Object Model (DOM) set of
        classes, as specified by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM">W3
        Consortium</a>.
    <DT>ezcgi
    <DD> Implements easy CGI scripting. A single class methods needs to be overridden
        in order to generate a complete CGI script.
    <DT>gettext
    <DD> A unit to implement resource strings by means of the GNU gettext
        tools.
    <DT>htmldoc
    <DD> Contains a Free Pascal implementation of a Document Object Model (DOM) set of
        classes for HTML, as specified by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM">W3
        consortium</a>.
    <DT>httpapp
    <DD> A http application class. Incomplete and not maintained at the moment.

    <DT>inifiles
    <DD> Contains an implementation of a TInifile class.
    <DT>iostream
    <DD> Contains an implementation of a stream that can be used to access standard
        input, standard output and standard error.

    <DD> Contains a <b>TDataset</b> descendent that can be used to access a MySQL
        database.
    <DT>pipes
    <DD> Contains streams that access each other through a pipe. What is written to
        stream 1, can be read from stream 2.
    <DT>rtfpars
    <DD> Contains a <b>RTF</b> (Rich Text Format) parsing class.
        All that needs to be done is set some event handlers and you can display
        RTF wherever you want.
    <DT>sh_pas
    <DD> A syntax highlighting object for Pascal syntax.
    <DT>sh_xml
    <DD> A syntax highlighting object for XML documents.
    <DT>shedit
    <DD> A text editor core with syntax highlighting capabilities.
    <DT>xmlcfg

<p> There are some errors in the new linker shipped with Xcode 3.0/Mac OS X 10.5. A detailed overview was posted to the <a href="http://lists.freepascal.org/lists/fpc-pascal/2007-October/015365.html">fpc-pascal mailing list</a>. We have worked around most of those issues and created (stable) development snapshots for both <a href="ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/snapshot/v22/powerpc-macosx/fpc-2.2.1-r8950.powerpc-macosx.dmg">PowerPC</a> and <a href ="ftp://ftpmaster.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/snapshot/v22/i386-macosx/fpc-2.2.1-r8950.intel-macosx.dmg">Intel</A>. These are intended to be installed on top of the 2.2.0 release version. Future releases will have these fixes incorporated. </p>
<p> One linker bug cannot be completely worked around in the compiler, which is related to the Stabs debugging format. For this reason, we recommend to switch to the Dwarf debugging format on Mac OS X 10.5. On the command line, you can do this by using -gw instead of -g to generate debugging information. In the Xcode projects, add -gw at the end of the <b>FPC_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS</b> project setting for the <i>Debug</i> configuration. </p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p> There is some limited possibilities to debug programs in classic Mac OS. See <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/MPW_debugging">MPW debugging</a> in the wiki. </p>
<p> As an alternative, you might do the main debugging in a Mac OS X/Darwin

<h1><a name="MacDialect"></a>The Mac Dialect</h1>
<p>There are three major Pascal dialects: Turbo Pascal (extended to
    Delphi, supported by FreePascal, and partially by Gnu Pascal),
    Extended Pascal (an ISO standard, supported by Gnu Pascal, DEC
    Pascal, Prospero Pascal), and the dialect originating from Apple
    (commonly used in the Mac community, supported by MPW Pascal,
    Metrowerks Pascal and Think Pascal). We call this dialect Mac Pascal
    and there is a special language mode for it: MacPas. </p>
<p>Mode MacPas is a compatibility mode. It is probably not
    possible to mimic the Mac Pascal dialect in detail. So the goal is to
    implement often used constructs, if this doesn't require too much
    effort, as well as easy-to-implement constructs.</p>
<p>To use MacPas, add <I>-Mmacpas</I> to the command line or insert the
    compiler directive <I>{$MODE MACPAS}</I> in the source code.</p>
<p>Note that the mac pascal dialect and mac targets are not
    interrelated. It is thus possible to write a mac program with the
    turbo dialect and to write a Windows program with the mac dialect. </p>
<p> The following are supported:

    Mac compiler directives like $SETC, $IFC, $ELSEC, $ENDC, $J, $Z.
    Most of the constructs found in interface files, especially
    Apples Universal Interfaces. Cycle, Leave, Otherwise. More is planned.

Push mirroring minimalizes the time it takes for changed to propagate to
mirrors by signaling immediately after ftpmaster.freepascal.org has been
updated. It uses a ssh-trigger to signal the mirrors to execute the mirrorscript, for details see
<a href="http://www.debian.org/mirror/explain">this page at www.debian.org</a>

The ftpsync files have to reside in the homedir of the user that will rsync,
preferably an ordinary user.
If you want your mirrorsite to be push mirrored, you will have to add the key
to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in order to be pushed. After you have setup
everything mail <a href="mailto:mirrors&#x040;freepascal.org">us</a>, so we can add
you to the push-list. Your e-mail has to include the user that will be used

Some FPC users have observed issues with delivery of e-mails from FPC (and
other) mailing lists. Yahoo has decided to implement
<a href="http://postmaster.yahoo.com/errors/postmaster-28.html">a DMARC policy</a>, which effectively disallows the use of e-mail accounts hosted by them
to subscribe to mailing lists. Unfortunately, none of the proposed solutions for mailing
lists are usable at this point in time.
  </li>
  <li>
Note that not only Yahoo (and AOL) e-mail accounts are affected, but also e-mail
accounts hosted by other companies that have implemented DMARC policy
support, because they have to respect the Yahoo's DMARC policy (blocking
mailing lists) and thus they reject e-mails sent from Yahoo addresses to the
mailing lists. Addresses from such DMARC-compliant providers may be in turn
also be disabled and/or unsubscribed by the mailing list software
when their mail servers start rejecting e-mails sent from Yahoo
addresses to the mailing lists. Among others, such providers include e.g.
Microsoft (hosting e.g. outlook.com and hotmail.com addresses).

The FreePascal team is pleased to announce official support for native
Android targets in the trunk SVN repository.
  </li>
  <li>
In addition to the existing Android support using the Java VM target,
you can now use the FreePascal compiler to generate native executables
and libraries. You can now speed up your performance critical code on
x86 and ARM CPUs writing in Object Pascal.
  </li>
  <li>
We hope that the Android target will attract new and old developers. It
may still be a little rough on the edges. We appreciate your feedback
and further contributions.

Recently, considerable progress has been reached with regard to
support of new CPU architectures. This includes not only new support
for MIPS processors running in both little endian and big endian
modes (contributed mostly by Florian, Pierre and external
contributors like Fuxin Zhang), but most notably also revived
support for Motorola 68000 family. M68k was originally the second
architecture supported by FPC even before release 1.0, but this
target has been dormant since the transition to FPC 2.x and now is
resurrected mostly by Sven. The compiler can be natively compiled for
M68000 and M68020 (although not necessarily fully working there yet) and
support for modern Coldfire CPUs is now in mostly working state too. Some
functionality still needs finishing (e.g. threadvars which impacts StdIO
among others), but created binaries already run successfully in QEMU. As of
now, the goal is to support m68k-linux and maybe also m68k-embedded.
Contributors for any other operating systems like Amiga, AROS or even
classic Mac OS are - as usual - welcome.

        win32, FreeBSD and Linux platforms on the intel (x86) architecture are

        steadily expand during the 1.9.x beta series, which will culminate
        ultimately in the 2.0 release.

    Preparing beta releases for more OSes would take too much time of the core developers. Of course, any

        Finally, the long awaited successor to 1.0.6 is out. It is called 1.0.10, and is a (mostly) fixes release.
        The reason for skipping 1.0.8 is that the release process took too long, and temporary files have been
        exposed too long on the FTP site, so the FPC team decided to make the final release 1.0.10.<p>
        This release is expected to be the absolute last release in the 1.0 fixbranch.
        Development will now be completely focused on the main branch (1.1) where significant

       There was a bug in the compiler which caused the graph unit of the Dos version

  <li>The default assembler uses another syntax, but you can turn on the
      Intel styled assembler reader (which is what Turbo Pascal uses) using the -Rintel

only if you absolutely need to, as non-alignment of fields may not
work on non-Intel processors (and will slow down data access in all cases).</li>

  <li>To get TP/Delphi-compatible set layouts, use the {$packset 1} directive (in FPC 2.5.1 and later, this is the default in TP/Delphi modes)</li>
  <li>Function results can also be complex types like arrays or records (not in TP mode)</li>
  <li>It is possible to handle the function result in a function like a variable (not in TP/Delphi mode):</li>

  <li>The above example would work with TP/Delphi, but they would assume
      that the <TT>a&gt;4 </TT>is a recursive call. To perform a recursive call in

delp(1)           Free Pascal file deletion tool          delp(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       delp - The Free Pascal file deletion tool.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>delp</b>


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>delp  </b>deletes files in the current directory that are left
       over from a Free Pascal compilation process. It knows what
       files can be produced by the compile steps and deletes any
       such files it finds. At the end it gives a summary of  the
       number  of  files  that  were  deleted,  together with the
       amount of bytes freed by this process.


<b>USAGE</b>
       <b>delp </b>takes no options at this time. It just attempts to
       delete all known files.


<b>FILE TYPES:</b>
       The following file types are recognized by the program and
       are deleted:

       <I>*.exe  </I>Executable files under dos and windows.

       <I>*.so *.dll</I>
              Shared libraries under linux and Windows.

       <I>*.tpu *.tpp *.tpw *.tr</I>
              Turbo Pascal compiled units.

       <I>*.log *.bak</I>
              Backup files and log files.

       <I>*.ppu *.o *.a *.s</I>
              Compiled units, object files, archives  and  assem-
              bler  files  created by the Free Pascal compiler on
              Linux or Dos

       <I>*.ppw *.ow *.aw *.sw</I>
              Compiled units, object files, archives  and  assem-
              bler  files  created by the Free Pascal compiler on
              Windows.

       <I>*.pp1 *.o1 *.a1 *.s1</I>
              Compiled units, object files, archives  and  assem-
              bler  files  created by the Free Pascal compiler on
              the go321v1 platform.

       <I>*.ppo *.oo *.ao *.so</I>

fpcmake(1)       Free Pascal Makefile constructor      fpcmake(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       fpcmake - The Free Pascal makefile constuctor program.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>fpcmake [filename [filename [filename]]]</b>


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>fpcmake </b>reads a <I>Makefile.fpc </I>and converts it to a <I>Makefile</I>
       suitable for reading by GNU <I>make </I>to compile your projects.
       It  is  similar  in functionality to GNU <I>autoconf </I>or <I>Imake</I>
       for making X projects.


<b>USAGE</b>
       <b>fpcmake </b>accepts filenames of makefile description files as
       it's  command-line  arguments.  For each of these files it
       will create a <I>Makefile </I>in the  same  directory  where  the
       file is located, overwriting any other existing file.

       If no options are given, it just attempts to read the file
       <I>Makefile.fpc </I>in the current directory and  tries  to  con-
       struct  a Makefile from it.  any previously existing <I>Make-</I>
       <I>file </I>will be erased. See <b>fpcmake</b>(5) for a  description  of
       the format of the <I>Makefile.fpc </I>file.

<b>NAME</b>
       Makefile.fpc - Configuration file for fpcmake.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <I>Makefile.fpc  </I>is a configuration file for the fpcmake com-
       mand. Starting from this file a  <I>Makefile  </I>is  created  to
       compile Free Pascal units and programs.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>Makefile.fpc  </b>is a plain ASCII file that contains a number
       of sections as in a Windows <I>ini </I>file. The  following  sec-
       tions are recognized (in alphabetical order):

       <b>clean  </b>Specifies rules for cleaning the directory of units
              and programs.  The  following  entries  are  recog-
              nized:

              <I>units  </I>names  of  all  units that should be removed
                     when cleaning. Don't specify extensions, the
                     makefile will append these by itself.

              <I>files  </I>names of files that should be removed. Spec-
                     ify full filenames.

       <b>defaults</b>
              The defaults section  contains  some  default  set-
              tings. The following keywords are recognized:



       <b>dirs</b>

       Units   will   be   installed    in    the    subdirectory
       <I>units/$(OS_TARGET) </I>of the <I>dirbase </I>entry.

       <b>libs   </b>This  section specifies what units should be merged
              into a library, and  what  external  libraries  are
              needed. It can contain the following keywords:

              <I>libname</I>
                     the  name of the library that should be cre-
                     ated.

              <I>libunits</I>
                     a comma-separated list of units that  should
                     be moved into one library.

              <I>needgcclib</I>
                     a  boolean  value that specifies whether the
                     gcc library is needed. This will  make  sure
                     that the path to the GCC library is inserted
                     in the library search path.

              <I>needotherlib</I>
                     a boolean value that tells the makefile that
                     other library directories will be needed.

       <b>packages</b>
              Which  packages must be used. This section can con-
              tain the following keywords:

              <I>packages</I>
                     A comma-separated list of packages that  are
                     needed  to  compile  the targets.  Valid for
                     all platforms.  In  order  to  differentiate
                     between  platforms, you can prepend the key-
                     word <I>packages </I>with the OS you are  compiling
                     for,  e.g.   <I>linuxpackages  </I>if  you want the
                     makefile to use the listed packages on linux
                     only.

              <I>fcl    </I>This  is a boolean value (0 or 1) that indi-
                     cates whether the FCL is used.

              <I>rtl    </I>This is a boolean value (0 or 1) that  indi-
                     cates  whether the RTL should be recompiled.

       <b>postsettings</b>
              Anything that is in this section will  be  inserted
              as-is in the makefile <I>after </I>the makefile rules that
              are generated by fpcmake, but  <I>before  </I>the  general

              of a  series  of  boolean  keywords;  each  keyword
              decies whether a particular section will be written
              to the makefile. By default, all sections are writ-
              ten.

h2pas(1)     Free Pascal C header conversion utility     h2pas(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       h2pas - The C header to pascal unit conversion program.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>h2pas </b><I>[options] filename</I>


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>h2pas  </b>attempts  to  convert  a  C header file to a pascal
       unit.  it can handle most C constructs that one finds in a
       C  header  file,  and  attempts to translate them to their
       pascal counterparts. see the <b>CONSTRUCTS </b>section for a full
       description of what the translator can handle.


<b>USAGE</b>
       H2pas  is  a  command-line tool that translates a C header
       file to a spascal unit. It reads the  C  header  file  and
       translates  the C declarations to equivalent pascal decla-
       rations that can be used to access code written in C.

       The output of the h2pas program is written to a file  with
       the same name as the C header file that was used as input,
       but with the extension <I>.pp</I>.  The output  file  that  h2pas
       creates  can be customized in a number of ways by means of
       many options.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       The output of <b>h2pas </b>can be controlled with  the  following
       options:



       <b>-d     </b>use <I>external; </I>for all procedure and function decla-
              rations.

       <b>-D     </b>use <b>external </b><I>libname <b></I>name </b><I>'func_name' </I>for  function
              and procedure declarations.

       <b>-e     </b>Emit  a  series of constants instead of an enumera-
              tion type for the C <I>enum </I>construct.

       <b>-i     </b>create an include file instead of a unit (omits the
              unit header).

       <b>-l </b><I>libname</I>
              specify the library name for external function dec-
              larations.

       <b>-o </b><I>outfile</I>
              Specify the output file name. Default is the  input
              file name with the extension replaced by <I>.pp </I>"."

       <b>-p     </b>use  the  letter <b>P </b>in front of pointer type parame-
              ters instead of "^".

       <b>-s     </b>Strip comments from the input file. By default com-
              ments  are  converted  to comments, but they may be
              displaced, since a comment is handled by the  scan-
              ner.

       <b>-t     </b>prepend  typedef type names with the letter <b>T </b>(used
              to  follow  Borland's  convention  that  all  types
              should be defined with T).

       <b>-v     </b>replace  pointer  parameters  by  call by reference
              parameters.  Use with care because some  calls  can
              expect a NIL pointer.

       <b>-w     </b>Header  file  is  a win32 header file (adds support
              for some special macros).

       <b>-x     </b>handle SYS_TRAP of the PalmOS header files.


<b>CONSTRUCTS</b>
       The following C declarations  and  statements  are  recog-
       nized:


       <b>defines</b>
              defines  are  changed into pascal constants if they
              are simple defines.  macros are changed -  wherever
              possible  to  functions;  however the arguments are
              all integers, so these must  be  changed  manually.
              Simple  expressions  in  define staments are recog-

              substraction,   multiplication,  division,  logical
              operators, comparision operators, shift  operators.
              The C construct ( A ? B : C) is also recognized and
              translated to a pascal construct with an IF  state-
              ment (this is buggy, however).


       <b>preprocessor statements</b>
              the  conditional  preprocessing commands are recog-
              nized and translated into  equivalent  pascal  com-
              piler directives. The special <b>#ifdef __cplusplus </b>is
              also recognized and removed.



       <b>typedef</b>
              A typedef statement is changed into a  pascal  type
              statement.  The  following  basic  types are recog-
              nized:

ppdep(1)       Free Pascal unit dependency tracking      ppdep(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       ppdep - The FPC Pascal unit dependency tracking program.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ppdep </b>[-DDefine] [-oFile] [-eext] [-V] [-h] [A[call]] file


<b>Description</b>
       <b>ppdep </b>dumps the dependencies of a unit in  a  format  that
       can  be  understood  by  GNU <b>make </b>output. It takes care of
       dependencies both in the interface and implemntation  sec-
       tion of the unit, and it can handle conditional defines.


<b>Usage</b>
       You  can  invoke  <b>ppdep </b>with as the only required argument
       the name of the file (program or unit)  whose  dependecies
       you  wish to list. You don't need to specify an extension,
       by default <b>.pp </b>is assumed.


<b>Options</b>
       <b>ppdep </b>has several options, which are case insensitive:


       <b>-a</b><I>call </I>This option tells <b>ppdep </b>to generate a compiler call
              for  the makefile. The compiler call will be gener-
              ated for each file that is  found  in  the  current
              directory.  If  you  do no specify an explicit com-
              piler call, <b>ppc386 </b>is used.

       <b>-d</b><I>keyword</I>
              This option defines <b>keyword</b>
               that can be used to  verify  conditional  defines.
              <b>ppdep  </b>understands  conditional defines, you should
              use this switch if the <I>uses </I>clause of the  programs
              or units can contain conditional defines.

       <b>-e</b><I>ext  </I>This  allows  you  to specify a different extension
              for the unit files.  By default, <b>.ppu  </b>is  assumed.
              This extension is written to the makefile.

       <b>-f</b><I>[call]</I>
              This option tells <b>ppdep </b>to generate a compiler call
              for the makefile. The compiler call will be  gener-
              ated  only  for  the file that was specified on the
              <b>ppdep </b>command line. If you want to generate a  com-
              piler  call for each file found, use the <I>-a </I>option.
              If you do no specify  an  explicit  compiler  call,
              <b>ppc386 </b>is used.

       <b>-h     </b>Shows a short help screen.

ppdep(1)       Free Pascal unit dependency tracking      ppdep(1)


       <b>-o</b><I>file </I>This  option  allows you to specify a file to which
              the dependencies should be written. By default  the
              dependencies  are  written  to standard output.  If
              you specify this option, the dependencies are writ-
              ten to <b>file</b>

              instead.

       <b>-v     </b>Writes  some  diagnostic  messages. If you use this
              option, be sure to use <I>-o </I>as well, since the  diag-
              nostic  messages  will  also be written to standard
              output.

<b>NAME</b>
       ppudump - The FPC Pascal unit dump program.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <I>ppudump </I>[-h] [-v[h|i|m|d|s|b|a]] ppu-file1 ppufile2 ...


<b>Description</b>
       <b>ppudump  </b>writes the contents of a Free Pascal unit file to
       standard output.  It gives a listing of all definitions in
       the unit file. The format of the listing can be controlled
       by the options.


<b>Usage</b>
       You can invoke ppudump with as arguments the names of  the
       units that you want to dump. You need not specify a exten-
       sion, by default <I>.ppu </I>is assumed. The output goes to stan-
       dard output.


<b>Options</b>
       <b>ppudump </b>has only two options:

ppufiles(1)    Free Pascal unit object file lister    ppufiles(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       ppufiles - The FPC Pascal unit object file lister.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ppufiles </b>[options] [file [file [file]]]


<b>Description</b>
       <b>ppufiles  </b>lists  all  the  binary files that are needed to
       link a unit  file.  This  includes  any  object  files  or
       libraries that must be linked in through some directive in
       the unit.


<b>Usage</b>
       You can invoke <b>ppufiles </b>with as arguments the name of  the
       units  whose  object  files you wish to list. An extension
       must be given. This can be useful for creating  a  listing
       of  all  created object files and deleting them in a Make-
       file.


<b>Options</b>
       <b>ppufiles </b>has several options, which are case insensitive:


              <b>-a     </b>This  option  tells  <b>ppufiles  </b>to  list  all

              <b>-h     </b>Help screen.

              <b>-l     </b>This  option  tells  <b>ppufiles  </b>to  list only
                     shared libraries.

              <b>-o     </b>This option  tells  <b>ppufiles  </b>to  list  only
                     object files.

              <b>-s     </b>This  option  tells  <b>ppufiles  </b>to  list only
                     static libraries.

<b>ERRORS</b>
       In case the unit is in an older  or  unrecognised  format,
       ppufiles will complain about that.

<b>NAME</b>
       ppdep - The FPC Pascal unit mover.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ppumove  </b>[-sqbhw]  [-o  File]  [-d  path]  [-e  extension]
       files...


<b>Description</b>
       <b>ppumove </b>collects one or several Free Pascal unit files and
       archives them in a static or shared library.


<b>Usage</b>
       You  can invoke <b>ppumove </b>with as the only required argument
       the name of the unit  from  which  you  want  to  make  an
       archive.  Specifying multiple files is also possible, they
       will be put in the same archive.


<b>Options</b>
       <b>ppumove </b>has several options, which are case sensitive:


       <b>-b     </b>This option tells <b>ppumove </b>to write a  shell  script
              (a  batch  file  on  DOS)  that performs the needed
              calls to <b>ar </b>and  <b>ld</b>.  The  script  will  be  called
              <b>pmove</b>,  with an extension of <b>.sh </b>on Linux, and <b>.bat</b>
              on DOS. You can  then  call  this  script  manually
              afterwards.


       <b>-d </b><I>path</I>
              This option tells <b>ppumove </b>where to generate the new
              unit files.  By default, this is the same directory
              as  where  the  files are found.  If you specify as
              the output extension  the  same  extension  as  the
              units you want to move, not specifying the destina-
              tion directory may cause problems.


       <b>-e </b><I>ext </I>This option sets the  extension  of  the  new  unit
              files to <b>ext</b>. By default <b>.ppl </b>is used. However, you
              can specify <b>.ppu </b>as the extension. If  you  do,  be
              sure  to  use also the <I>-d </I>switch, or you will over-
              write the old units. Note however,  that  the  com-
              piler  will  only look for extensions <b>.ppu </b>and <b>.ppl</b>
              when looking for units.


       <b>-h     </b>Shows a short help screen.

              This option allows you to specify the name  of  the
              library  to be generated.  You <b>must </b>use this option
              if you specify more than one unit on  the  command-
              line.  If  you  specified only one unit on the com-
              mand-line, the generated library will have the unit
              name,  with  <b>lib  </b>prepended (on Linux).  You do not
              need  to  specify  the  <b>lib  </b>part,  this  will   be
              prepended automatically if needed.

ptop(1)               ptop source beautifier              ptop(1)


<b>NAME</b>
       ptop - The FPC Pascal configurable source beautifier.

       Origin probably Pascal-TO-Pascal.


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>ptop</b><I>[-v]  [-i  indent]  [-b  bufsize ][-c optsfile] infile</I>
       <I>outfile</I>


<b>Description</b>
       <b>ptop </b>is a more or less configurable <I>source beautifier  </I>for
       pascal  sources,  and  specially the ones supported by FPC
       (which are more or less Turbo Pascal or Delphi 2.0 compat-
       ible).

       ptop  belongs  to  the  <I>FPC utils </I>package, which currently
       also contains <b>ppdep </b>, <b>h2pas </b>, <b>ppudump </b>and <b>ppumove</b>


<b>Usage</b>
       <b>ptop </b>basically reformats "infile" and outputs  the  result
       to  "outfile".  ituses a configuration file explained fur-
       ther below, and can generate a  default  configurationfile
       for you to edit. (not needed if you use the defaults)


<b>Options</b>
       <b>-h     </b>Writes a short description of these switches.

       <b>-c     </b>read  options from configuration file. A configura-
              tion file is not needed, ptop will revert to inter-
              nal defaults then. See also -g

       <b>-i </b><I>ident</I>
              Sets  the  number  of  indent spaces used for BEGIN
              END; and other blocks.

       <b>-b </b><I>bufsize</I>
              Sets the buffersize to bufsize. Default 255,  0  is
              considered non-valid and ignored.

       <b>-v     </b>be  verbose.  Currently  only outputs the number of
              lines read/written and some error messages.

       <b>-g </b><I>ptop.cfg</I>
              Writes a default configuration file to be edited to
              the file <I>ptop.cfg</I>

       The program is a modernized (OOP, Streams,  Delphi  exten-
       sions) version based on a program by Peter Grogono, who in
       turn based his program on a Pascal pretty-printer  written
       by Ledgard, Hueras, and Singer.  See SIGPLAN Notices, Vol.
       12, No. 7, July 1977, pages  101-105,  and  PP.DOC/HLP.
       This version of PP developed under Pascal/Z V4.0 or later.
       Very minor modifications for Turbo Pascal made by  Willett
       Kempton  March 1984 and Oct 84.  Runs under 8-bit Turbo or
       16-bit Turbo.  Toad Hall tweak, rewrite for TP 5,  28  Nov

ptop.cfg(5)     ptop source beautifier config file    ptop.cfg(5)


<b>NAME</b>
       ptop.cfg  - The ptop source-beautifier configuration file.

       ptop is the source beautifier of the FreePascal project.

       Origin probably Pascal-TO-Pascal.cfg


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       This is the main configuration file of the <I>ptop FPC source</I>
       <I>beautifier</I>

       The  configuration  file  for  <b>ptop</b>(1)  isn't  necessarily
       called ptop.cfg, and is also not auto-loaded, so the  name
       doesn't matter much. This man-page describes the structure
       of such a configuration file for <b>ptop</b>(1)


<b>Structure</b>
       The structure of a ptop configuration  file  is  a  simple
       buildingblock  repeated  several  (20-30)  times, for each
       pascal keyword known to the ptop program. (see the default
       configuration  file  or  ptopu.pp source to find out which
       keywords are known)

       The basic building block of the  configuration  file  con-
       sists  out of one or two lines, describing how ptop should
       react on a certain keyword.  First a line  without  square
       brackets with the following format:

       keyword=option1,option2,option3,...

       If  one of the options is "dindonkey" (see further below),
       a second line (with square brackets) is needed like this:

       [keyword]=otherkeyword1,otherkeyword2,otherkeyword3,...

       As you can see the block contains  two  types  of  identi-
       fiers,  keywords(keyword  and  otherkeyword1..3  in  above
       example) and options, (option1..3 above).

       <I>Keywords </I>are the built-in valid  Pascal  structure-identi-
       fiers  like  BEGIN, END, CASE, IF, THEN, ELSE, IMPLEMENTA-
       TION. The default configuration file lists most of  these.

       Besides the real Pascal keywords, some other codewords are
       used for operators  and  comment  expressions.  These  are
       listed in the following table:

       Name of codeword         operator
       -------------            -----
       casevar                  : in a case label (&lt&gt'colon')
       becomes                  :=
       delphicomment            //

ptop.cfg(5)     ptop source beautifier config file    ptop.cfg(5)


       opencomment              { or (*
       closecomment             } or *)
       semicolon                ;
       colon                    :
       equals                   =
       openparen                [
       closeparen               ]
       period                   .


       The  <I>Options </I>codewords define actions to be taken when the
       keyword before the equal sign is found.

       Option              does what
       -------             ---------
       crsupp              suppress CR before the keyword.
       crbefore            force      CR      before      keyword
                           (doesn't go with crsupp :) )
       blinbefore          blank line before keyword.
       dindonkey           de-indent   on   assiociated  keywords
                           (see below)
       dindent             deindent (always)
       spbef               space before
       spaft               space after
       gobsym              Print symbols which follow a
                           keyword but which do not
                           affect layout. prints until
                           terminators occur.
                           (terminators are hard-coded in pptop,
                           still needs changing)
       inbytab             indent by tab.
       crafter             force CR after keyword.
       upper               prints keyword all uppercase
       lower               prints keyword all lowercase
       capital             capitalizes keyword: 1st letter
                           uppercase, rest lowercase.


       The option "dindonkey"  requires  some  extra  parameters,
       which  are  set by a second line for that keyword (the one
       with the square brackets), which is therefore only  needed
       if   the  options  contain  "dinkdonkey"  (contraction  of
       de-indent on assiociated keyword).

       "dinkdonkey" deindents if any of the keywords specified by
       the extra options of the square-bracket line is found.


<b>Example</b>
       The line

       else=crbefore,dindonkey,inbytab,upper
       [else]=if,then,else

ptop.cfg(5)     ptop source beautifier config file    ptop.cfg(5)


       Means:

       The  keyword this is about is <I>else </I>, it's on the LEFT side
       of both equal signs.


       When the ptop parser finds ELSE, the options tell it to do
       the following things:

       - (crbefore) Don't allow other code on the line before
          the keyword. (ELSE alone on a line)
       - (dindonkey) De-indent on the keywords
            in square brackets line (if,then,else)
       - (inbytab) indent by tab.
       - (upper) uppercase the keyword (ELSE)


       Try  to play with the configfile until you find the effect
       you desire. The configurability and possibilities of  ptop
       are  quite  large  compared to shareware source beautifier
       found on e.g. SIMTEL.

<h1><a href="tools.var">Tools that come with Free Pascal</a></h1>
Free Pascal comes with several command-line tools that you can use to ease
your programming. The following tools are available:
<OL>
<li> <a href="h2pas.var"><b>h2pas</b></a> is a small command-line
utility that can be used to translate C header files to pascal units.
The Free Pascal team uses it to make import units for important C libraries
such as GTK or MySQL.
<li> <a href="fpcmake.var"><b>fpcmake</b></a> is a tool that allows
you to make complex makefiles to compile programs and units with FPC. The
Free Pascal team uses it to create all it's makefiles.
<li> <a href="ppdep.var"><b>ppdep</b></a> is a small utility that
scans a program or unit and creates a depend file that can be used for
inclusion by make. It understands conditional symbols and interdependency of
units.
<li> <a href="delp.var"><b>delp</b></a> is a small utility that scans
a directory for files left over by the Free Pascal compiler, and deletes
them.
<li> <a href="ppudump.var"><b>ppudump</b></a> dumps the contents of
a unit in human-readable format. It understands older versions of units and
gracefully handles unknown (future) versions.
<li> <a href="ppufiles.var"><b>ppufiles</b></a> lists the object files that
you need to link in when using a unit file. It lists all libraries and units
that are needed.
<li> <a href="ppumove.var"><b>ppumove</b></a> combines several units
into one; as such it can be used to create static and dynamic libraries.
<li> <a href="ptop.var"><b>ptop</b></a> is a configurable source
formatter. It pretty-prints your pascal code, much like <TT>indent</TT> does
for C code.
<li> <a href="rstconv.var"><b>rstconv</b></a> is a small utility that
converts <b>.rst</b> files (files that contain resource strings, as created
by the compiler to some other format. (GNU gettext at the moment)
<li> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181116101101/http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-mainz.de/~ag/tply/tply.html"><b>TP Lex and Yacc (Wayback, site defunct since approx. 2019-01-01)</b></a>, written by <A
