<h2>Advantages of programming in Pascal and Free Pascal</h2>
Maybe you think, why should I choose Pascal instead of, for example C. Or
maybe you are comparing Free Pascal to another Pascal compiler. Well, in
that case, be sure to read this page before making your decision. Well,
for what is Free Pascal so good?
<p>
<ul>
    <li><STRONG>Very clean language</STRONG> Pascal is a very nice language,
    your programs will be more readable and maintainable than for example in
    C, and let's even forget about C++. And you don't need to give up the
    power, the Pascal language is as powerful as you want it.
    <li><STRONG>No Makefiles</STRONG> Unlike most programming languages,
    Pascal does not need Makefiles. You can save huge amounts of time, the
    compiler just figures out itself which files need to be recompiled.
    <li><STRONG>Pascal compilers are Fast with a big F and Free Pascal
    is no exception.</STRONG> Yes, you no longer need to grow roots while
    compiling your programs, just hit the compile key and it's done, even
    for large programs.
    <li><STRONG>Each unit has it's own identifiers</STRONG> In Pascal you
    never need to worry about polluting the namespace, like in C where
    an identifier needs to be unique accross the entire program. No, in
    Pascal each unit gets it's own namespace and that's very relaxed.
    <li><STRONG>Integrated development environment</STRONG> Free Pascal comes
    with an IDE which work on several platforms, in which you can write, compile
    and debug your programs. You will save huge amounts of time using the IDE,
    the best programming friend you have.
    <li><STRONG>Great integration with assembler</STRONG> Do you think pascal is
    for wimps who need to learn programming? WRONG! It's excellent for high tech
    programming and for the supreme nerds among you we have the integrated
    assemblers. You can easily mix assembler code and Pascal code, in the
    language you wish? Prefer Intel styled assembler? No problem, if it's needed
    Free Pascal will convert it to ATT for you. Do you want to convert your
    program into a source file for Nasm? No problem, and all ATT assembler in
    your source files is automatically converted.
    <li><STRONG>Object oriented programming</STRONG> And if you do the serious
    programming, you are of course very interested in object oriented
    programming. Use the Turbo Pascal and Object Pascal ways of OOP according
    to your taste. The FCL and Free Vision and provide you with the powerful
    object libraries you need. For your database needs we support PostgreSQL,
    MySQL, Interbase and ODBC.
    <li><STRONG>Smartlinking</STRONG> Free Pascal's smart linker leaves out any
    variable or code that you do not use. That makes small programs small with
    a big S, while they are still statically linked, avoiding DLL hell!
    <li><STRONG>Distribution independence (Linux)</STRONG> As a result of this,
    software compiled by the Linux version of Free Pascal runs on any
    Linux distribution, making it much, much, easier to make your software
    support multiple Linux distributions.
    <li><STRONG>Available for a lot of platforms on several architectures</STRONG>
    Free Pascal is
    available for more platforms than most other Pascal compilers and allows
    easy cross-compiling, just change the target in the IDE and compile! And
    there is work going on for even more platforms and processors.
    <li><STRONG>Compatible</STRONG> Have existing code? Free Pascal is more
    compatible with it than any other Pascal compiler. We are almost completely
    compatible with Turbo Pascal and quite well compatible with Delphi source
    code. If you have code in another language, like C or assembler, just
    use favorite compiler for it and call it from Free Pascal.
