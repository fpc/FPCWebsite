<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
  Free Pascal (aka FPK Pascal) is a 32 and 64 bit professional Pascal compiler.
  It is available for different processors: Intel x86, Amd64/x86_64, PowerPC,
  Sparc. The discontinued 1.0 version also supports the Motorola 680x0.
  The following operating systems are supported: Linux, FreeBSD,
  <a href="fpcmac.html">Mac OS X/Darwin</A>, <A HREF="fpcmac.html">Mac OS classic</A>, DOS, Win32, OS/2,
  Netware (libc and classic) and MorphOS.
</P>

<H2>Features</H2>
<P>
  The language syntax has excellent compatibility with TP 7.0 as well as
  with most versions of Delphi (classes, rtti, exceptions, ansistrings, widestrings, interfaces).
  A Mac Pascal compatibility mode is also provided to assist Apple users. Furthermore
  Free Pascal supports function overloading, operator overloading, global properties and
  other such features.
</P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>
<b>x86 architecture:</b>
<blockquote>For the 80x86 version at least a 386 processor is required, but a 486
is recommended.</blockquote>
<b>PowerPC architecture:</b>
<blockquote>Any PowerPC processor will do. 16 MB of RAM is required. The Mac OS
classic version is expected to work System 7.5.3 and later. The Mac OS X version
requires Mac OS X 10.1 or later, with the developer tools installed.
On other operating systems Free Pascal runs on any system that can run the operating
system.
</blockquote>
<b>ARM architecture</b>
<blockquote>
Only cross-compiling to ARM is supported at this time.
</blockquote>
<b>Sparc architecture</b>
<blockquote>
16 MB of RAM is required. Runs on any Sparc Linux installation.
